# 🥗 Integrated Food Safety Analytics Project

## 📋 Objective
The Integrated Food Safety Analytics Project aims to develop a comprehensive Business Intelligence (BI) solution for analyzing and reporting food establishment inspection data from Chicago, Dallas, and another city. The project encompasses data extraction, profiling, dimensional modeling, staging, integration, and reporting using various BI tools.

## 🚀 Key Deliverables
- Data Extraction and Profiling:
  - Extracted, cleaned, and staged data in TSV format with metadata for tracking.
  - Utilized tools like YData Profiling and Alteryx for data profiling to understand structure, content, and quality.

- Dimensional Modeling:
  - Designed and implemented a dimensional model to fit BI solution requirements.
  - Created Data Definition Language (DDL) SQL scripts to define the schema of the dimensional model.

- Data Integration:
  - Developed Talend ETL workflows to read data from staging tables and load it into the integration schema.
  - Ensured data integrity by adding surrogate keys and metadata columns like `DI_CreateDate` and `DI_WorkflowFileName`.
  - Validated the process with SQL scripts and output screenshots for row count comparison before and after the load.

- BI Dashboards:
  - Developed interactive dashboards in Power BI and Tableau to visualize inspection results and trends.
  - Designed user-friendly dashboards highlighting key metrics and KPIs, enabling real-time insights.
